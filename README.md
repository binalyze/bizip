bizip is a command-line tool that allows users to unzip and combine zip files that are outputs generated by Binalyze products. This tool is designed to work with Binalyze products and may not be suitable for general-purpose zip file management.

# Installation

# Usage

After installing bizip, you can use it to unzip and combine zip files by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./bizip --encrypted --input "test_data/image*.zip" --output test_data/test_data --unzip
```

## Flags

- `--encrypted`: If this flag is set, the input zip files are expected to be encrypted zip files. The password for decryption should be stored in the `PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `--input`: The input zip files should be specified specified using the glob pattern. For example, "test_data/image*.zip" will match all files under test_data folder having image prefix with .zip file extension. Note that, matched files are sorted before processing.
- `--output`: The output file name and path.
- `--unzip`: If this flag is set, the input zip files will be unzipped before they are combined. If this flag is not set and the input zip files are encrypted, the output file will also be an encrypted zip file.
